##  About the challenge
This is a Makers Academy week 2 weekend challenge. We are building a takeaway app that fulfils the below user requirements.

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```
### Getting Started
* Fork this repo
* Run the command 'bundle' in the project directory to ensure you have all the gems
* Register an account at Twilio if you do not already have one
* Create an .env file to store your Twilio details and phone numbers to be used for the texting functionality of this app.

### Usage
Begin with creating a new Takeaway instance
 `t = Takeaway.new`
Have a look at the menu for what is on offer
`t.show_menu`
Order a dish by its name and desired quantity
`t.order('katsu curry', 2)`
Display the basket summary of items in quantity and price
`t.basket_summary`
Show the basket current cost total
`t.show_total`
Checkout the order
`t.checkout(price)`
### Notes
This app consists of the main `Takeaway `class - which allows the user to input the above described methods, the `Menu` class - which allows Takeaway to invoke the menu-display and associated methods, the `Basket` class - which acts as a container for ordered items and its pricing information to be accessed later, and finally, the `Texter` class - which sends a text to the customer to inform them of their estimated delivery time.

The texting functionality is created using Twilios API. To obtain the credentials needed, an account needs to be registered on their website, where the Auth Token and Account SID can be accessed. These information will need to be stored as `ENV` variables within the working directory. By using bundle, you will install the `sinatra`, `dotenv` and `twilio-ruby` gems which will support Texters send_text method.

```

* Hints on functionality to implement:
  * Ensure you have a list of dishes with prices
  * The text should state that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
  * The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
  * Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
  * Use the Gemfile to manage your gems
  * Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
  * However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
  * Note that you can only send texts in the same country as you have your account. I.e. if you have a UK account you can only send to UK numbers.

* Advanced! (have a go if you're feeling adventurous):
  * Implement the ability to place orders via text message.

* A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.

> :warning: **WARNING:** think twice before you push your **mobile number** or **Twilio API Key** to a public space like GitHub :eyes:
>
> :key: Now is a great time to think about security and how you can keep your private information secret. You might want to explore environment variables.

* Finally submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am


In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* High [Test coverage](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md) (>95% is good)
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.

Reviewers will potentially be using this [code review rubric](docs/review.md).  Referring to this rubric in advance will make the challenge somewhat easier.  You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this at this moment.

Notes on Test Coverage
